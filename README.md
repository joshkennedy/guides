* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

#### A note on the language:

* **"Avoid"** means don't do it unless you have good reason.
* **"Don't"** means there's never a good reason.
* **"Prefer"** indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
* **"Use"** is a positive instruction.
